# Overview 🐻
[**Bearshare-Pot**](https://bit.ly/4g7PmCs) 🐻💰 is a script (bot) powered by NodeJS and JavaScript to automatically claim the daily reward from [**Bearshare**](https://bit.ly/4g7PmCs)🐻.

The script is designed to be run in a docker environment, allowing it to be deployed alongside the Bearshare docker container.

It uses very minimal resources, resulting in the CPU utilisation staying at idle **0%** the entire time unless logging into the website.
```

> This script comes pre-bundled with [**Income Generator**](https://github.com/XternA/income-generator). A tool which consolidates and earns passive income from multiple sources.

| Variable | Description | Mandatory |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |

Or supply credentials in a Dotenv `.env` file.
```markdown

PASSWORD=<password_credential>
```

# Docker Deployment 🐋
### Compose
File: `compose.yml`
```yaml
services:
  bearshare-pot:
    container_name: bearshare-pot
    image: xterna/bearshare-pot
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - EMAIL=$EMAIL
      - PASSWORD=$PASSWORD
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8
```

With Bearshare app docker image.
```yaml
services:
  bearshare:
    container_name: bearshare
  image: xterna/bearshare
    restart: always
    environment:
      - EMAIL=$EMAIL
      - PASSWORD=$PASSWORD
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8

  bearshare-pot:
    container_name: bearshare-pot
    image: xterna/bearshare-pot
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - EMAIL=$EMAIL
      - PASSWORD=$PASSWORD
    dns:
      - 1.1.1.1
      - 8.8.8.8
    depends_on:
      - bearshare
```

Execute where compose file is located.
```yaml
docker compose up -d
```

ℹ️ **Note:** If you apply resource limits such as CPU and RAM you need to set the following bare minimum:
```
  - cpu=0.8
  - mem_limit=350m
```
The script won't be able to run properly and will constantly timeout if the CPU and RAM limit is set lower than recommended. This is only required during the boot-up phase where it needs to spin up a headless browser to connect to the site. Resource is most intensive only during this phase.

### CLI
Using environment variable or Dotenv `.env` defined e.g.
```sh
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name bearshare-pot -e EMAIL=$EMAIL -e PASSWORD=$PASSWORD xterna/bearshare-pot
```

Directly passing credentials.
```sh
docker run -d --restart unless-stopped --name bearshare-pot -e EMAIL=example.gmail.com -e PASSWORD=pass123 xterna/bearshare-pot
```
This will start the application in the background. The alias assigned is `bearshare-pot`.
